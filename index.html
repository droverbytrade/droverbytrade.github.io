<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello, I’m a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer (akad. Rat auf Zeit) at the <a href="http://www.iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/">Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=9441\&amp;L=1">University of Cologne</a>, Germany. These pages provide information on my research and teaching, available also as a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cklf1o689gx7jvx/cv_kuehhirt_fira.pdf?dl=0">cv</a>.</p>

<p>I have attained both an M.A. (sociology, modern history, and economic history) and a PhD in social sciences (Dr. rer. soc.) at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/">University of Mannheim</a>, Germany. My dissertation research focused on the consequences of having children for paid and unpaid work of men and women in (West) Germany. Coming from a rural working class background, I’ve now grown more and more interested in the role of family characteristics and behaviors in social reproduction through their immediate impact on child development.</p>

<p>Originally, I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Thuringia">Southern Thuringia</a>, a region known for its winter sports athletes, sausages, and unexpected <a href="http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~x8wisu/dialektforschung/dialektgebiete/hennebergisch/sprachprobehennebergisch.html">Franconian dialect</a>. This birthplace has naturally endowed me with an inexhaustible enthusiasm for all things mountain and forest. But I also enjoy books, films, music, Werder Bremen, and BBC nature documentaries narrated by Sir David Attenborough.</p>
