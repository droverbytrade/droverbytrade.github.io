In addition, I'm involved in a number of projects that fall within the larger area of social stratification and life course research, namely

* trends in employment-related gender attitudes (with Christian Ebner and Philipp Lersch),
* and Matthew effects in the National Basketball Association (NBA) (with Thomas Biegert and Wim van Lancker).
