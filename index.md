## About

Hello, I'm a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer (akad. Rat auf Zeit) at the [Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology](http://www.iss-wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/) at the [University of Cologne](https://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=9441\&L=1), Germany. I have attained a PhD in social sciences (Dr. rer. soc.) at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/), Germany. It was also there, that I completed my M.A. (magister artium) studies in sociology, modern history, and economic history.

Originally, I hail from [Southern Thuringia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Thuringia), a region known for its winter sports athletes, sausages, and unexpected [Franconian dialect](http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~x8wisu/dialektforschung/dialektgebiete/hennebergisch/sprachprobehennebergisch.html). Upon completion of secondary school and subsequent community service work at a retirement home run by the Germen Red Cross, I moved to Mannheim in 2003, where I've been living ever since.

These pages provide information on my research and teaching.--
