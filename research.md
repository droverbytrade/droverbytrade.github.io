## Research

My research focuses on how family processes and relationships shape individual life courses and contribute to social stratification and inequality. Within this subject area, I'm particularly interested in two topics: (1) How do family events like childbirth or divorce impact the work life and wellbeing of men and women? (2) How do (dynamic) aspects of the family context like parental education and employment, neighborhood deprivation, or parenting style affect children's development?

To answer these questions, I apply quantitative methods to large scale, often longitudinal, survey data. Because my research mostly addresses causal relations, I have a deep and abiding interest in modern methods of causal inference (which I also delight in teaching). In recent years, I've become a fervent believer in [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). Therefore, I now strive to provide documentation that allows others to reproduce my research with minimal effort.

For publications and current projects, here's my [cv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cklf1o689gx7jvx/cv_kuehhirt_fira.pdf?dl=0).
