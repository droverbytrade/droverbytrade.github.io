## Research

My research is located at the intersection of sociology, demography, and developmental psychology. It typically focuses on how family processes and relationships shape individual life courses and contribute to social stratification and inequality. Within this subject area, I'm particularly interested in two questions:
1. *How and why do family events, like childbirth or divorce, impact the work life and wellbeing of men and women?* 
2. *How and why do (dynamic) aspects of the family context, like parental education and employment, neighborhood deprivation, or parenting style, affect children's development?*

To answer these questions, I apply quantitative methods to large scale, often longitudinal, survey data. Because my research mostly addresses causal relations, I have a deep and abiding interest in modern methods of causal inference (which I also delight in [teaching](/web-causal-inference)). 

In recent years, I've become a fervent believer in [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). Therefore, I now strive to provide documentation that allows others to reproduce my research with minimal effort (e.g., [here](https://osf.io/m8trg)).

#### Current projects

At the moment, I'm mainly working on two overarching topics that are immediately connected to my core research interests outlined above. 

1. Parenthood, divorce, and the health and wellbeing of men and women
* motherhood and physical activity (with Nadine Reibling)
* disability, divorce, and subjective wellbeing of men and women in Germany (with Jack Lam)
2. Family context and child development
* [trends in inequality of educational opportunity in East and West Germany](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3e9ud/) (with Markus Klein and Katherin Barg)
* [cumulative exposure to neighborhood deprivation and children's behavior problems](https://osf.io/bj3fu)
* [tv consumption and child development](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Markus_Klein7/project/Child-development-in-a-dynamic-family-context/attachment/59e74d494cde2617ef84f630/AS:550793556262912@1508330825704/download/slls_gus.pdf?context=ProjectUpdatesLog) (with Markus Klein)

In addition, I'm involved in a number of projects that fall within the larger area of social stratification and life course research, namely
* the labor market returns to studying abroad (with Marita Jacob and Margarida Rodrigues),
* trends in employment-related gender attitudes (with Christian Ebner and Philipp Lersch),
* and Matthew effects in the National Basketball Association (NBA) (with Thomas Biegert and Wim van Lancker).
