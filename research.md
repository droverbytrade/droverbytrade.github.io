My research draws on theories and concepts from sociology, demography, and developmental psychology to investigate the formation of social inequalities over the life course. Within this research area, I mainly focus on the following three overarching topics which investigate how different life events, family processes and relationsships, and gender shape individual life courses and thereby contribute to social stratification and inequality:

1. *[Family events and the work life and wellbeing of men and women](/careers)*

2. *[The social stratification of child development](/develop)*

3. *Determinants of individual careers*

To contribute to these topics, I apply quantitative methods to large-scale, often longitudinal, survey data. Because my research often addresses causal relations, I have a deep and abiding interest in modern methods of causal inference (which I also delight in [teaching](/web-causal-inference)). 

In recent years, I've become a fervent believer in [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). Therefore, I now strive to provide documentation that allows others to reproduce my research with minimal effort (e.g., [here](https://osf.io/m8trg)).
