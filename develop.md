title: Social Stratification of Child Development
---

This line of research focuses on how classic markers of social stratification (e.g., social origin, sex/gender) and dynamic aspects of the family context (e.g., parental employment, living environment, parenting practices) (jointly) contribute to social inequality in different dimensions of child development (e.g., cognitive skills and educational attainment, behavior, health). A particular focus is on highlighting and accounting for the complex temporal and causal interdependencies between the different factors shaping children's life courses and inequality therein.
