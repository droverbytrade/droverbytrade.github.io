My preferred approach to teaching is to use a substantive topic to illustrate broader concepts in empirical social research that students can later transfer to other theoretical and practical areas. While the facts and figures within a specific topic are important, I consider these a means to an end to understand more fundamental aspects regarding theory and methodology. When teaching methodology in particular, I insist on first understanding a specific problem (e.g., the curse of dimensionality) before introducing its technical fixes (e.g., more or less elaborate statistical models) thus emphasizing the motivation for and the limitations of methods.

In terms of teaching practices, I'm eager to combine lectures, assignments, and labs with tools like online quizzes or Q&A platforms (with varying success). Generally, I find that what works in the classroom very much depends on the particular group of students so I don't believe in any golden formula and try to remain flexible and adaptive in my approach (while keeping a lookout for rigorous empirical research on teaching practices).
