Teaching is an integral part of my scientific work and of my identity as a social researcher. In my view, the collective toolkit of social research is uniquely equipped to endow students of all backgrounds with the theoretical and practical skills to become engaged and critical citizens, voters, consumers, and patients. Therefore, (while acknowledging the stark limits of the individual) I'm convinced that teaching social research plays a vital role in maintaining and developing democratic societies in times of massive disinformation campaigns, [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), and ["post-factual" politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics).

This conviction translates into my approach to teaching in that I strive to go beyond facts and figures and illustrate broader concepts of social research, which students can transfer to other classes as well as their careers and personal lives. This particularly involves the practice of skills to not only obtain information but also to process and criticially evaluate it. A key ingredient of my approach is to blend substantive content on specific topics and methodology. In substantive classes, I highlight methodological challenges that are key to interpreting the available empirical evidence. In classes with a methodological focus, I discuss the theoretical and substantive motivations for specific techniques using existing research. 

In terms of teaching practices, I'm eager to combine lectures, assignments, and labs with tools like online quizzes or Q&A platforms. Generally, I find that what works in the classroom very much depends on the particular group of students so I don't believe in any golden formula and try to remain flexible and adaptive in my approach (while keeping a lookout for rigorous empirical research on teaching practices).
