Teaching is an integral part of my professional life and of my identity as a social researcher. In my view, the collective toolkit of the social sciences is uniquely suited to equip students of all backgrounds with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to navigate an increasingly complex world as engaged and critical citizens, voters, and consumers. Therefore, (while acknowledging the certain limits of the individual) I'm convinced that teaching social research has an important function in democratic societies, particularly so in times of massive disinformation campaigns, [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), and [post-factual politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth_politics).

This conviction translates into my approach to teaching in that I always strive to integrate theory, methodology, and evidence, assisting students in acquiring skills they can readily transfer to other classes but also their careers and personal lives. This particularly involves the practice of skills to not only obtain information but also to process and criticially evaluate it. In doing so, I apply active learning methods like in-class quizzes, online Q&A, cooperation platforms, or practical labs. Generally, I find that what works in the classroom very much depends on the particular group of students so I try to remain flexible and adaptive in my approach (while keeping a lookout for rigorous empirical research on learning practices).
